# WEB102 Prework - *Sea Monster Crowdfunding*

Submitted by: **Jerry Vasquez**

**Sea Monster Crowdfunding** is a website for the company, Sea Monster Crowdfunding, that displays information about the games they have funded. The website displays stats such as the individual contributions, total amount raised, total number of games, and the top funded games. Following the stats, the user is able to see the list of all games that are currently being fund raised. The user is also provided filter options to see which games have acheived their funding goals and which games have not. 

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Notes

A challenge that I faced when developing the application was figuring out how to implement the "scroll back to top" feature that I added into the filter buttons. When the user clicks any of the filters, the page will scroll back up to the beginning of the games container in addition to the game cards being filtered accordingly. To over come this, I had to search the web for examples on how this was implemented. After finding the logic, I opened up a new project to experiment with what I have learned. When I felt confident with my understanding of the logic, I implemented it on this project. Overall, I felt that the majority of the project was straightforward.
