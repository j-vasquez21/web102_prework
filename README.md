Submitted by: **Jerry Vasquez**

**Sea Monster Crowdfunding** is a website for the company, Sea Monster Crowdfunding, that displays information about the games they have funded. The website displays stats such as the individual contributions, total amount raised, total number of games, and the top funded games.
